# Web application demo of double eyelid simulator
 - This was a model deployment project when I was RA For [Jing Peng](https://www.business.uconn.edu/person/jing-peng/) & [Hongfei Li](https://www.hongfei-business.com/) during the spring of 2019.

 - I used Flask Web framework to deployed the model and the demo can be found here https://bowen.pythonanywhere.com/.
