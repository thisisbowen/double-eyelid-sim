# Web Application Demo of Double Eyelid Simulator
 - This was a model deployment project when I was RA For [Jing Peng](https://www.business.uconn.edu/person/jing-peng/) & [Hongfei Li](https://www.hongfei-business.com/) during the spring of 2019.

 - I used [Flask Web framework](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) to deploy the model.
 - The demo website can be found [here](https://bowen.pythonanywhere.com/). (You might need to translate to English...)

 - the model file is not included in the repo to protect the modeler's copyright.
